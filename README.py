2. Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)

GRU is another variant of RNN, similar to LSTM, but with a simpler architecture. GRUs use fewer gates compared to LSTMs, which reduces computational complexity and speeds up training.

    Why GRU for stock prices?
        GRU is simpler than LSTM and can be just as effective for certain tasks, particularly when you have less data.
        It also handles sequence data well and has shown good performance on various time series problems.
