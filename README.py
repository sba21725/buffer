Here's an example of hyperparameter tuning for an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast stock closing prices. We’ll use Keras to build the model and Scikit-Learn's RandomizedSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning. The hyperparameters that are often tuned in LSTM include:

    Number of units (neurons) in the LSTM layers
    Batch size for training
    Epochs for training
    Learning rate for the optimizer
    Dropout rate to prevent overfitting

This example demonstrates how to use RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning on these parameters. We’ll split the data into training and testing sets and use the MSE (Mean Squared Error) as the evaluation metric.
