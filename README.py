3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Time Series

While CNNs are typically used for image data, they can also be effective for time series data. CNN can extract local patterns from the time series, which can help identify trends and patterns over fixed-length windows.

    Why CNN for stock prices?
        CNNs can learn local patterns from time series, which can help capture short-term trends in stock prices.
        They are computationally efficient and can be combined with LSTM or GRU to capture both local and sequential patterns.
