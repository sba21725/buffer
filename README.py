Hereâ€™s an example of hyperparameter tuning for an ARIMA model to forecast stock closing prices using Python. ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) models have three main hyperparameters to tune:

    p: the order of the AR term (number of lag observations)
    d: the degree of differencing (number of times the data is differenced)
    q: the order of the MA term (size of the moving average window)
