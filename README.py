1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

LSTM is one of the most widely used neural network architectures for time series forecasting, including stock prices. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly the problem of vanishing gradients. It is capable of learning long-term dependencies and handling sequences of data efficiently.

    Why LSTM for stock prices?
        LSTM networks are effective for capturing sequential dependencies, making them suitable for time series data where the current stock price depends on previous prices.
        They are better at handling longer sequences and remembering important features over time, which is critical in the highly temporal nature of stock price data.
