5. Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)

TCN is a newer model that is essentially a convolutional network designed specifically for sequence modeling tasks. It uses dilated convolutions, which allows it to capture longer-term dependencies without the need for recurrent structures.

    Why TCN for stock prices?
        TCNs can capture long-term dependencies with fewer parameters and faster training times compared to LSTM.
        It maintains the sequence length, which is beneficial for forecasting tasks like stock prices.

Final Thoughts

While LSTM and GRU are popular choices for stock price prediction due to their ability to handle sequential dependencies, itâ€™s important to remember that stock prices are inherently noisy and influenced by many external factors. No model will perfectly predict stock prices, but with proper feature engineering, scaling, and model tuning, these neural network models can help identify patterns and trends.

For stock price forecasting:

    LSTM is typically the best starting point.
    Hybrid models (CNN + LSTM) can provide a more robust solution.
    GRU can be considered if you need faster training with simpler architecture.

The choice of model should also consider the size of your dataset, computational resources, and how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
